## Technical Implementation

### Image Recognition
Upcycle uses **Google Cloud Vision API** to analyze and identify common household waste items that can be repurposed.

### AI-Powered Suggestions
Our backend leverages GPT-based models to generate creative upcycling ideas based on identified items, user preferences, and trending projects.

### Real-time Updates
Firebase Firestore provides real-time synchronization for the community feed and marketplace listings.

### Offline Access
Local storage (Room for Android and Core Data for iOS) caches projects and user preferences for offline use.
